## ‚ö†Ô∏è Confidentiality Notice

Due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to publicly share full projects or source code for most of my freelance work. Many small businesses and startups I collaborated with used NDA-based contracts, which explicitly prohibit publishing the full project code.

However, I have extracted and modified selected non-sensitive parts of those projects, such as UI components (menus, cards, sliders, etc.), and shared them here for demonstration purposes.

In real scenarios, these components were often adapted or customized according to the client's specific needs as part of the full project.

## üéì Highlighted Project (Skill Development Institute)

One of the more complete projects showcased here is a website for a skill development institute for children and teenagers. The code was written without using Webpack or Gulp, for simplicity and compatibility.

To protect privacy:
- I replaced the original photos of the instructors.
- Some sensitive or client-specific content has been modified or anonymized.

The code and structure remain true to the original project and are presented here to showcase my front-end development skills in a real-world context.
